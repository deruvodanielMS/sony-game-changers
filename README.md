This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies, and then run the development server:

```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Storybook

Run Storybook for isolated component development:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view the component library.

Build Storybook for production:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```
